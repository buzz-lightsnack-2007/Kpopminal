# Kpop'minal
Watch K-pop music videos in an ASCII format. 

_Uses [`video-to-ascii` by joelibaceta](https://github.com/joelibaceta/video-to-ascii)_. 

## How it came
One thing fascinating about command lines is that they can do many things that GUIs do, such as moving files, editing files, etc. 

However, there are some things that CLIs can't do. You can't watch videos in there out of the box. 

But there is _The Matrix_ that plays in ASCII. You can also watch a recreated _Star Wars_ just by using the `telnet` command. 

**So what about watching k-pop videos in the terminal?** 

With the help of [joelibaceta's `video-to-ascii`](https://github.com/joelibaceta/video-to-ascii), this is actually possible. 

## What it does
Give the artist name, give the music video name, and run. 

A script will be downloaded containing the ASCII version of the k-pop music video. This only works in POSIX and Linux OSes.
